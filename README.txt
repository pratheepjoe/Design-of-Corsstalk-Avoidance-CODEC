Modern CMOS technology involves massive level of integration of several components in a single chip. Busses are widely used as a communication mechanism in such system-on-chips. However, the signal integrity is highly affected by crosstalk between the wires in bus-based communication. Crosstalk affects the system’s performance widely by increasing power dissipation and timing violations in the system. Crosstalk Avoidance Codes (CAC) are highly desirable over other crosstalk avoidance schemes such as shielding and spacing. CAC efficiently reduces the effective coupling capacitance between the neighboring wires thus effectively reducing the power dissipation of the busses. In this project, three crosstalk avoidance schemes (Forbidden Overlap Code, Forbidden Pattern Code, and Forbidden Transition Code) have been implemented and studied on the basis of area requirement, energy dissipation and timing constrains. In addition, we have identified the effective length of these codes beyond which the performance and energy is comparably better than un-coded scheme.
